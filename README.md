*As of: **11-05-2025**<br/>
This project is a work in progress and will expand greatly over time.*

## UsoUIElements is the Garage-Ware Games implementation of Unity's UIElements (UI Toolkit)

This package is used as the base UI for all Garage-Ware Games applications written for Unity.
This system is designed to make the Unity Data Binding 
system much simpler to use.

Our implementation can be directly dropped into an existing UI Toolkit project by 
adding the 'Uso' prefix to any control, so 'Button' becomes 'UsoButton' and so on.

All fields have the following features:
* Validation indicators (working)
* Unified USS theme (in development)
* Built in formating options (pending)
* Special <code>FORM</code> container elements with additional validation 
  features (in development)
* Special <code>DISPLAYSECTIONS</code> container elements for grouping 
  fields with data sources, allowing for multiple data sources in a single form. (in testing)
* Simplified Data binding (working)
* Standardized Constructor Signatures (working)
